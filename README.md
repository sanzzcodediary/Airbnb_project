# Airbnb Price Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)

This project explores pricing trends in Airbnb listings using a dataset with three key components:
- Listing details (location, bedrooms, property type, etc.),
- Price information,
- Reviews.

The goal of the project is to visualize and understand how Airbnb prices vary by location (zipcode), number of bedrooms, and throughout the year.

## 🔍 Dashboard Highlights

- **Price by Zipcode**: Mapped average prices across different Seattle zipcodes and visualized the same data in a bar chart for comparison.
- **Listing Distribution**: Counted the number of listings by number of bedrooms to show how common each type is.
- **Average Price vs Bedrooms**: Analyzed how the average nightly price increases with the number of bedrooms.
- **Seasonal Revenue Trends**: Visualized how average Airbnb revenue fluctuates over the months to identify peak seasons.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used

- **Tableau** for data visualization
- **Data Cleaning & Joining** (multi-table)
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- **Basic Spatial Mapping (zipcode-level)**

## 📁 Files Included

- `Airbnb_Price_Analysis.twbx` – Tableau packaged workbook
- `data/` – Contains CSVs (or a sample of the dataset)
- `README.md` – This file

## 📈 Insights

- Listings with more bedrooms tend to have a higher average price, but are less common.
- Prices peak in the summer months (June–August).
- Some zipcodes (e.g., 98101) have significantly higher average prices than others.

- Incorporate review scores or sentiments for quality-based pricing analysis.
- Include interactive tooltips or drilldowns in Tableau for more user interaction.
